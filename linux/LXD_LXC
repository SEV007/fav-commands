LXD and LXC are two distinct implementations of Linux containers1234.
LXC is a low-level user space interface for the Linux kernel containment features,
consisting of tools, templates, and library and language bindings13. 
LXD is a more intuitive and user-friendly tool aimed at making it easy 
to work with Linux containers124. LXD is built on top of LXC to provide a new, 
better user experience34. It uses LXC through liblxc and its Go binding to create and manage the containers

LXCFS is a small FUSE filesystem written with the intention of making Linux containers 
feel more like a virtual machine. It started as a side-project of LXC but is useable by any runtime.
LXCFS will take care that the information provided by crucial files in procfs such as:
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/diskstats
/proc/meminfo
/proc/stat
/proc/swaps
/proc/uptime
/proc/slabinfo
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online
