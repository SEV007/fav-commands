LXC, while older, has not been as popular with developers as Docker has proven to be. 
This is partly due to the difference in use cases that these two technologies focus on, with
LXC having a focus on sys admins that’s similar to what solutions like the Solaris operating system, 
with its Solaris Zones, Linux OpenVZ, and FreeBSD, with its BSD Jails virtualization system. These solutions 
provide OS containers for a whole system, which is achieved, typically, by providing a different root for the filesystem,
and creating environments that are isolated from each other and can’t share state. 

LXD and LXC are two distinct implementations of Linux containers1234.
LXC is a low-level user space interface for the Linux kernel containment features,
consisting of tools, templates, and library and language bindings13. 
LXD is a more intuitive and user-friendly tool aimed at making it easy 
to work with Linux containers124. LXD is built on top of LXC to provide a new, 
better user experience34. It uses LXC through liblxc and its Go binding to create and manage the containers

LXCFS is a small FUSE filesystem written with the intention of making Linux containers 
feel more like a virtual machine. It started as a side-project of LXC but is useable by any runtime.
LXCFS will take care that the information provided by crucial files in procfs such as:
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/diskstats
/proc/meminfo
/proc/stat
/proc/swaps
/proc/uptime
/proc/slabinfo
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online
