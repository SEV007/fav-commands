LXD and LXC are two distinct implementations of Linux containers1234.
LXC is a low-level user space interface for the Linux kernel containment features,
consisting of tools, templates, and library and language bindings13. 
LXD is a more intuitive and user-friendly tool aimed at making it easy 
to work with Linux containers124. LXD is built on top of LXC to provide a new, 
better user experience34. It uses LXC through liblxc and its Go binding to create and manage the containers
