GitHub wrong user push solution

git config --global push.default simple


it looks like my terminal does the commits with my username, but pushes them with the other one

Author and committer name and email (which are important for GitHub) are derived from:

git config user.name
git config user.email
However, as mentioned in git config and git commit-tree, those values can be overridden by environment variables:

GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
So double-check those variables.

Things work back normally if I force the user in the .git/config of a repository but I don't think that's the good option.

But it should be a good solution.
When using an https url, I always specify the user in it to make sure the authentication is done with the right user.
