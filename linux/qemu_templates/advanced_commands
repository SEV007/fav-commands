Dirty Bitmaps and Incremental Backup
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/interop/bitmaps.html
This document explains the conceptual mechanisms, as well as up-to-date,
complete and comprehensive documentation on the API to manipulate them. (Hopefully, the “why”, “what”, and “how”.)

The intended audience for this document is developers who are adding QEMU backup features to management applications,
 or power users who run and administer QEMU directly via QMP.
