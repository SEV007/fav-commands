mhVTL & WebUI â€“ Prebuilt VM Download
By Max | 15 Jan 20173 Comments
Recently to ease deployment of VTL resources in lab environments I built a pre-configured VM containing the mhVTL and the WebUI (GUI) with iSCSI support.  I figured I could share that VM here for the community.  The resulting OVA file has been tested successfully with VMware Fusion, Workstation, and Oracle Virtual Box.

Download mhVTL.ova here

The VM is based on CentOS 6.8 with only minimal packages installed to support the mhVTL and mhVTL-GUI web interface with iSCSI support.  As such there is no OS GUI.

Network configuration is set to DHCP and the hostname is set to mhvtl.example.pvt

Shell / SSH login user is root using the password of P@ssw0rd

A second virtual disk has been mapped to /vtl-media and is thin provisioned and expandable to 32GB in size.

 

Following deployment it is recommended you complete the following prior to connecting the VM to your network:

Set the Hostname
Open the following file into a text editor, like VI or Nano.
01
vi /etc/sysconfig/network
Change the hostname value to the fully qualified name of your computer.
HOSTNAME=mhvtl.example.pvt
Save your changes and exit the text editor. The new name will be applied after your next reboot.
Set a DHCP Address
Note that the NIC may change to eth1 depending on the VM environment being deployed into.

Open the configuration file for the first network interface, eth0, into a text editor.
01
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
Modify the file to look similar to the example below.
DEVICE=eth0
TYPE=Ethernet
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes
NAME="System eth0"
Save your changes and exit the text editor.
Restart the network service.
02
service network restart
Set a Static IP Address
Note that the NIC may change to eth1 depending on the VM environment being deployed into.

Open the configuration file for the first network interface, eth0, into a text editor.
01
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
Modfy the configuration file to look similar to the one below.
DEVICE=eth0
TYPE=Ethernet
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=172.30.0.53
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=172.30.0.1
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes
NAME="System eth0"
Save your changes and exit the text editor.
Restart the network service.
02
service network restart
