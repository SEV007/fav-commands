MONTVOL

Link volumes without requiring a drive letter. Create, delete or list a volume mount point. NTFS junction mount points can only be used with local NTFS directories, (unlike DFS junction points which will target a network share). MOUNTVOL can be found on the Windows CD i386 folder.

Syntax
      MOUNTVOL [drive:]path VolumeName
      MOUNTVOL [drive:]path /D
      MOUNTVOL [drive:]path /L
      MOUNTVOL [drive:]path /p
      MOUNTVOL /R
      MOUNTVOL [/N | /E]
      MOUNTVOL drive: /S

Options

    path     : An existing NTFS folder where the mount point will reside.
